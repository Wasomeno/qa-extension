# QA Command Center

## Product overview

### Document details
- **Product:** QA Command Center
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** July 31, 2025
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive product requirements document for a browser extension that revolutionizes QA workflows through AI-powered issue creation, automated test recording, and seamless cross-platform integration

## Narrative

As a QA engineer, I start my day by opening the application I need to test. The QA Command Center extension is already running silently in the background, ready to capture my interactions. When I discover a bug in the checkout process, I simply right-click and select "Create Issue" from the context menu. I describe the problem in plain English: "The payment button becomes unresponsive after selecting express shipping on mobile view." The AI immediately generates a well-structured GitLab issue complete with acceptance criteria, proper severity classification, and assigns it to the frontend team based on the component involved. The system has automatically captured my last few minutes of interaction and generated a Playwright script that the developers can run to reproduce the exact issue. Within minutes, I receive a Slack notification that the developer has acknowledged the issue and is working on it. Throughout the fix process, I stay informed through synchronized updates between GitLab and Slack, and when the developer marks it as ready for testing, I have a complete test script ready to verify the fix. What used to take 30 minutes of documentation and back-and-forth communication now takes less than 5 minutes, letting me focus on finding more issues rather than managing them.
