# Description

## Problem to solve
The view needs to handle multiple projects and look "nice" as per requirements.

## Solution
1. Implement a "Nice Separator" component for project headers.
2. Ensure vertical stacking of projects works with scrolling.
3. Apply Shadow DOM styling fixes if needed.
4. Verify accessibility and visual hierarchy.
